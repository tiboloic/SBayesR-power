# SBayesR-power
Numerical integration for estimating the power of an SBayesR analysis


`sbayesr_power.R` contains all the functions to calculate power. The function
to call to do so is `pow_R_e`


`Figure7.R` generates figure 7 of the paper


files `get_power.R`, `sbayesc_power.R`, `sbayesc_test.R` are legacy files
and should be ignored
